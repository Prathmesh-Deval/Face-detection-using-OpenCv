# Face-detection-using-OpenCV
Detecting face from input video  using OpenCV and Haar-cascade classifier then extracting the face and saving extracted image into folder.

# Install below libraries
  pip install cv2

# INFO

In the program we will capture a short video and extract 20 frames from that video and save the frames into Data folder

Next we can take any frame and using Haar-cascade features we can detect face inside frame

in final step get the codinates of the face and extract the face image and save it in .jpg format.

# Thanks!
